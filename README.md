## Introduction

Word Cloud Generator is a simple Python script that generates a word cloud from a given text. Word clouds are graphical representations of word frequency that give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in a source text. This project uses the `wordcloud` and `matplotlib` libraries.

This project was created by [sonnymay](https://github.com/sonnymay).

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to make sure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/word-cloud-generator.git
cd word-cloud-generator
```

Now, install the required libraries:

```sh
pip install wordcloud matplotlib
```

## Usage

To generate a word cloud, simply run the script `wordcloud_generator.py`:

```sh
python wordcloud_generator.py
```

The script uses a default text to generate the word cloud. You can modify the script to use your own text.
